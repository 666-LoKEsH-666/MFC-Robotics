                <h2>Previous Research</h2>
                
                <h3>Tan et al. (2020) - Robotic Writing using Dobot</h3>
                <p>Tan and colleagues developed one of the first comprehensive frameworks for robotic handwriting specifically using the Dobot Magician platform. Their approach focused on trajectory optimization to minimize jerk during character formation, resulting in more natural-looking handwriting output. They implemented a spline-based smoothing algorithm that significantly reduced the mechanical vibrations common in robotic writing systems. Their system achieved character formation with a precision of Â±0.3mm, though it was limited to pre-programmed text rather than dynamic input from speech.</p>
                
                <h3>Williams (2022) - Learning Handwriting with Robotic Arms</h3>
                <p>Williams presented a novel approach using reinforcement learning to teach robotic arms to develop human-like handwriting patterns. Rather than programming explicit stroke patterns, the system learned writing styles by analyzing thousands of handwriting samples and optimizing a reward function based on legibility and aesthetic quality. The research demonstrated that machine learning approaches could generate more personalized writing styles compared to deterministic methods. However, the computational requirements made real-time operation challenging, with the system requiring significant pre-training before deployment.</p>
                
                <h3>Jiang (2021) - Stroke Optimisation for Robotic Text</h3>
                <p>Jiang's work addressed the critical challenge of optimizing stroke sequences to maximize writing efficiency while maintaining readability. Their system analyzed character formation to determine optimal pen-up and pen-down sequences, reducing unnecessary movements and minimizing writing time. By implementing a look-ahead path planning algorithm, their approach reduced total writing time by 27% compared to naive stroke sequencing methods. The research provided valuable insights into efficient trajectory planning for connected script writing, which we adapted for our current system.</p>
                
                <h2>Speech Recognition Technology</h2>
                
                <h3>Kaldi Speech Toolkit and Vosk API</h3>
                <p>The Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit represents one of the most comprehensive open-source frameworks for speech processing research. Developed primarily for research purposes, Kaldi implements state-of-the-art algorithms for acoustic modeling, feature extraction, and language modeling. The Vosk API, built on Kaldi's architecture, provides a more accessible interface for implementing speech recognition in practical applications, particularly for offline use cases. Vosk offers pre-trained models for multiple languages with a lightweight footprint suitable for edge computing environments. The combination of accuracy, offline operation, and minimal latency made Vosk the ideal choice for our speech processing component.</p>
